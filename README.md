 ## Testing

- I have conducted many tests to ensure the website works well, I have had to change the nav bar muliple times to make it sit properly which posed quite a challenge at first.

- I have checked the nav links work and bring the user to the right designated page.

- I have checked that all social media links are working fully and bring the user to the exact area specified.

- I have checked that the fixed background image on the home page does not stretch when scrolling.

- I have checked that the sign up form works and brings the user to the newsletter thank you page.

- I have checked the submit button css style works when clicking submit.

Getting the CSS to work perfectly proved to be a good learning curve as I had chosen not to use bootstrap to try challenge myself building everything from scratch.

the resolutions I have tested the website on are as follows 
- Desktop screen
- 1024px width
- 720px width
- 320px width
